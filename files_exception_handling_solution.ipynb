Examples include C, C++, and Rust. Since the translation happens beforehand, compiled programs typically run faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### An interpreted language, on the other hand, executes the source code line by line using an interpreter. This means there is no separate compilation step, but execution is usually slower because the translation happens at runtime. Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.\n",
